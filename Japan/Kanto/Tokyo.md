### Curry Rice üçõ
The tried and true. You can't go wrong with curry rice. Depending on the restaurant's specialization, there's probably some variations avalible. The beef curry rice is pretty standard. Chicken/pork katsu is a great way to add something extra and more substantial.

### Tempura üç§ü•¶ 
I usually get the vegetable tendon tempura. This usually consists of a medley of fried veggies on top of a bowl of rice. 

### How to Soba üçú
Soba is a buckwheat noodle dish. It's pretty simple but goes well with so many different dishes.

#### Cold ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Typically served with the noodles separate from the sauce. Using chopsticks, you pick up some soba noodles and dip them into the sauce. You can also mix in the green onions and wasabi into the sauce if you like.

#### Hot üî•
In my opinion, the definitive way to eat soba noodles. Usually served with all ingredients in a bowl, there's no excuse not to try this on one of the many days it's raining in Japan. I usually get it in a combo with a main dish (i.e. curry rice). I like to let the soba cool a bit and eat the main dish first. This was definitely one of my favorite meals in Japan (to be fair, I'm a pretty picky eater). The green onions taste great in the warm broth and the noodles are relatively filling.
